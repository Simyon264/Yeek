# Yeek

Yet another MIDI hosting site.

Yeek is a simple MIDI sharing site which started as a side project after friends kept asking me for my MIDI collection.

Primarily the main "selling point" is that you can mount the entire archive as a WebDAV network share. Oh also I guess the site generates previews for the MIDIs. Pretty neat too.
